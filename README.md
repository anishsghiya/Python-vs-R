# Python-vs-R
### A comparision between python and r programs for Data Science and Machine Learning

The dataset used for this repository is the Kaggle [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) dataset. 

```
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

1. Reading the dataset (*tidyverse and pandas*)
2. NA values and fixing them
3. Exploratory Aata Analysis (*ggplot2 and seaborn*)
4. Feature Engeering - 
    * Converting categorial features to one-hot or label-encoded features
    * Extracting title from name
5. Train Test Split (*caret and sklearn*)
6. 10 fold cross validated Machine Learning models with feature importances
    * Linear Discriminant Analysis
    * K Neighbors Classifier
    * Random Forest Classifier
    * Support Vector Classifier
