# Python-vs-R
A comparision between ```Python``` and ```R``` programs for Data Science and Machine Learning

# Dataset Used
The dataset used for this repository is the Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

# Pipeline followed

1. Reading the dataset (*tidyverse and pandas*)
2. NA values and fixing them
3. Exploratory Aata Analysis (*ggplot2 and seaborn*)
4. Feature Engeering - 
    * Converting categorial features to one-hot or label-encoded features
    * Extracting title from name
5. Train Test Split (*caret and sklearn*)
6. 10 fold cross validated Machine Learning models with feature importances
    * Linear Discriminant Analysis
    * K Neighbors Classifier
    * Random Forest Classifier
    * Support Vector Classifier
